                <strong>
                    Hello everyone! First off, to all of you thank you for visiting my site to read my reviews and listen to my anime music playlist!
            
            
                    To begin with, my name is Paul X. However my alias name is TiXz and I'd prefer to be called that instead :). I have been watching anime for quite some time now. I would say at least 13 years now. Moreover, writing a blog/review about the anime that I have finished has always been a dream of mine. Being able to  share it with others to recommend them a good anime show or avoid the not so well ones.
                </strong>

            <h2><strong><u>What Got You into Anime?</u></strong></h2>
            
            <p class="color-change"><strong>Well for starters I got into anime after being introduced to Naruto.
                <a href="aboutme/naruto.png"><img src="aboutme/naruto.png" alt="naruto"></a>
            
                    To be exact my brother was the one who introduced it to me as it started to become a popular show at the time.
            
            
                    After being hooked on the anime I started to explore more and the different genres that came with it. It was like a box of chocolates you could say!

            <h2><strong><u>What Are Your Favorite Genres?</u></strong></h2>
            
            <p class="color-change"><strong> I don't particularly have a favorite genre. However, if I were to choose it would have to be romance, fantasy, isekai, adventure, and comedy.
