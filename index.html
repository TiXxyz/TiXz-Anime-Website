                Welcome to my website where I do anime reviews on any anime that I have watched or am currently watching. Here I give my honest and unbiased opinion about the anime. However, I will only rate the anime only after I have finished watching it.

                <strong>
                    I will be rating each anime with 3 standards. Those would be story, characters, and artwork. I have always used these standards to give an honest and unbiased rating. These standards will be listed below:
            
            
                <h2><strong><i><u>Rating Standards:</u></i></strong></h2>
    
                <h3><strong><u>Story -</u></strong></h3> Is the story understandable and not jumbled up to the point where it's not followable.
            
            
            
                <h3><strong><u>Characters -</u></strong></h3> Are there any character developments? Not just the main character (aka MC) but support characters as well.
            
            
            
                <h3><strong><u>Artwork -</u></strong></h3>
                    For this category it is a little tough as each author has their own way drawing characters and scenery. However, I will only be focusing on the production of the anime artwork from studio to studion on where it was produced at. This is to be fair towards the author.
