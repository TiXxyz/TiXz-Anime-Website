            <u>Synopsis:</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Four Cardinal Heroes are a group of ordinary men from modern-day <br> Japan summoned to the kingdom of Melromarc to become its saviors. Melromarc is <br> a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the land <br> and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed <br> a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku,<br> becomes cursed with the fate of being the "Shield Hero." Armed with only a measly shield, <a href="reviews/naofumixraphtalia.jpg"><img src="reviews/naofumixraphtalia.jpg" alt="naofumixraphtalia"></a> <br> Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his <br> weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.
            
            When the heroes are provided with <br> resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train <br> alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely <br> accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against <br> and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm <br> of hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself <br> and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on his own sets in, <br> so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany <br> him on his travels.
            
            As the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight <br> for the survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.

        <p class="color-change"><b><u>Review:</u>
          <br>
            The complaint is that, by showing this, the anime sends the message that similar <br> allegations are not to be believed in real life. True anime fans, however, are able to <br> understand what message an anime is actually trying to send to its audience. <br>
            This anime sends a message of condemnation to advantage-seeking liars, as well as <br> a message of sympathy to any dismissed and silenced truth-tellers. It shows the pain <br> of trusting others, only to be vilified and doubted more for each truth you tell. The message <br> comes through the MC, a man, because that's who should hear it.
            There is also a lot of talk <br> about played stereotypes. There's a reason anime has formed tropes and traditions, and the reason <br> is you: the fan. Stereotypes and predictable banter is <br> the anime world's way of telling you: "You're one of us; let's laugh and cry together" <br> Don't let others shame you for appreciating the welcoming arms of anime culture. <br> For many, this is the one culture left that we can feel a part of. <br>
            Finally, this anime does in fact have some interesting aspects. <br> The mechanics of the MC's weapon, the origin of the enemy, the intent of the other heroes, <br> and the character progression of the two main characters. The animation quality is good, and, <br> probably most telling of all, time flies by too fast when watching it. <br>
            However, if you find yourself on the fence with anime, then you're probably not ready for this one yet.
            <br>
